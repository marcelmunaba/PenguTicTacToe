# PenguTicTacToe
PenguTicTacToe üêß

A simple TicTacToe game (with a slight twist) in Java. I made this project for my university course "PGdP" week 9. The rule of the game is on the .png file "Spielregeln.png" (in german).

Installation : Just clone the repository and run it directly through your IDE.

*Note that this game only has language support for german. English version coming soon ? :\

Have fun ! üêß
